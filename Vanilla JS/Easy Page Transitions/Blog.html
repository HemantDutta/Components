            <span class="data-title">Japan Baby Problem</span>
            <span class="synopsis">Japan, where the population graph looks less like a mountain and more like a ski slope. The land of sushi, samurai, and seniors, where finding someone under the age of 30 feels like discovering a mythical creature. With the birth rate doing its best impression of a rock rolling downhill and the elderly population continuing to climb like Mount Fuji, Japan is in a bit of a pickle. Who knew that in a nation famous for its high-tech toilets, it’d be the seniors running the show?</span>
            <span class="article">Japan, a country renowned for its cutting-edge technology, delicious cuisine, and…octogenarians? That's right! The island nation has more elderly folks than you can shake a walking cane at, with over 28% of the population now over 65. Some say the secret to their long life is a healthy diet of fish and fermented soybeans; others speculate it's from dodging all the marriage proposals they've refused over the decades. Either way, Japan has become a living episode of Golden Girls, but with way more kimonos and karaoke.</span>
            <span class="article">As the youth population shrinks faster than a sushi roll at lunchtime, the government has tried everything short of giving out babies as prizes in vending machines. There's even a rumor they’re considering a dating app called "Granny & Me" to help balance the demographics. Despite this, Japan continues to thrive, proving once again that if there's anyone who can handle a challenge with grace, style, and a cup of green tea, it's Japan's senior citizens. They're not slowing down; they're just mastering the art of aging—one karaoke night at a time.</span>
